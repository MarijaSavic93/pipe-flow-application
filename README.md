# pipe-flow-application
## Description

An Android application for calculating the fluid velocity and pressure drop per unit length due to friction in pipes.<br>
The application also calculates fluid density, viscosity, specific heat capacity and friction coefficient.

## Updates

In the future, users will be able to:

<!-- start list -->

- choose the type of fluid - water, glycol...
- enter pipe length
- enter local resistance coefficients

<!-- end list -->

Then, the application will be able to calculate the total pressure drop in the pipe.
