# pipe-flow-application
### Description
An Android application for calculating the velocity and pressure drop per unit length of heat transfer fluids (water) due to friction in pipes.<br>
The density, viscosity, specific heat capacity of the fluid, and the friction coefficient are calculated as well.
### Updates
In the future, users will also be able to:

<!-- start list -->

- choose the type of heat transfer fluid - water, glycol...
- enter pipe length
- enter local resistance coefficients

<!-- end list -->

which will make it possible to calculate the total pressure drop in the pipe.
